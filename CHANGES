       small caps letters in extension.

    *) Bugfix: if the proxy_pass or fastcgi_pass directives were set in the 
       location, and access was denied, and the error was redirected to a 
       static page, then the segmentation fault occurred.

    *) Bugfix: if in a proxied "Location" header was a relative URL, then a 
       host name and a slash were added to them; bug appeared in 0.1.14.

    *) Bugfix: the system error message was not logged on Linux.
